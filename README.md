# Year-2-Software-Engineering
This is the Software Engineering processes of theory. The Specification Case provided to us was:

The Global Tech Corporation embarked on an ambitious project to develop a next
generation, automated infrastructure system for supporting warehouse management. 
Global Tech Corporation decides to implement a new inventory management system 
(IMS) to streamline operations in Nepal. Last project they suffer from significant issues 
such as no clear scope without no documentation outlining the specific features, 
integration points or end goals for the new system. Poor resource allocation drags on 
for months, leading to budget overruns and delays in other critical warehouse 
operations. Communication between the teams is sporadic and unstructured. There are 
no regular meetings or progress reports. Potential risks, such as system downtime not 
identified or mitigated on time. After the IMS is implemented, there is no review to 
assess whether the project objectives were met to identify areas for improvement. Due 
to the lack of project management, the implementation of the new IMS is deemed a 
failure. The warehouse continues to struggle with inefficiencies, financial losses and 
customer dissatisfaction, Eventually, the Global Tech corporation decides to strictly 
emphasize project management with proper analysis and design too for the upcoming 
year project.

3.1 Detailed specification of GROUP task 
As a group task you are asked to produce a number of analysis and design    
specifications of a particular part of the system. 
Each group member should select ONE of the following ‘functions’ for their 
individual task and clearly specify their name and their chosen functions 
clearly. 
1. Access users to system: 
In an inventory system, users—Admin and customer(buyer) - register and login 
to access their specific role. 
2. Purchase Order: 
The Add Purchase function allows users to record new purchases of a product 
from a supplier, while View Purchase lets them review past purchase details.  
3. Generate Report: 
Report generation is a very essential feature to facilitate decision making for both 
admin and customers. The Purchase Report tracks new inventory acquisitions, 
detailing quantities, costs, and suppliers for customers. The Sales Report  should 
facilitate decision making for admin ranging from information of total sales, 
quantity to the profit and loss made during different points of time. 
4. Sales Management: 
Sales Management includes viewing the sales order, viewing delivery methods, 
address, contact information, dispatching details etc.

5. Product Management: 
Add Product used to input new products in the inventory system, while View 
Product provides quick access to current stock levels, sales history, and supplier 
data.  
6. Payment: 
While viewing the product, there should be a provision to compare prices between 
similar products in case customers want it. There should be an option to make 
payment for buyers to make payments for the inventories they purchase. The 
payment data should be securely stored and integrated with inventory 
management.
